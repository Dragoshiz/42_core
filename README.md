# 42 Core Projects

In this repository you find all the projects that I coded for the curriculum of 42 school.

# First Circle
## libft
This project is your very first project as a student at 42. You will need to recode a few functions of the C standard library as well as some other utility functions that you will use during your whole cursus.
<br/><br/>

# Second Circle
## get_next_line
Reading content with a buffer of given buffer size, line by line.
## ft_printf
Re-writing the well-known printf() function
## born2beroot
Setting up a virtual machine with a strong password policy and SSH connection.
<br/><br/>

# Third Circle
## FdF
“Iron Wire” meshing in 3D. With this program you can read coloured maps (e.g. of Mars) and display them, zoom in and out, etc...
## push_swap
The Push_swap project is a very simple and highly effective algorithm project: data will need to be sorted. You have at your disposal a set of int values, 2 stacks and a set of instructions to manipulate both stacks. Your goal ? Write a program in C called push_swap which calculates and displays on the standard output the smallest program using Push_swap instruction language that sorts the integer arguments received.
## pipex
This project is about handling pipes (and executing multiple commands) with parent and child processes.
<br/><br/>

# Fourth Circle
## Philosophers
Multithreading implementation of the [Dining philosophers problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dining_philosophers_problem).
## Minishell
2-person projects to create a shell with several functionalities like pipes, redirects, commands like `echo` & `ls`, retrieving and setting environment variables, signals and a lot of other stuff.
